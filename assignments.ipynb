        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Python is high level ,interpreted programming language its always known as its smiplicity and readability , versatility and large community and libraries etc is known as python.\n",
        "python popular is because is esay toread and write , verasatile and multipurpose  , massive community and libaries ,data science and ai friendly etc\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. Instead of compiling the entire program into machine code before running it (like a compiler does), the interpreter translates each Python statement into machine code and executes it immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning and syntax in the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or class names) because they are part of the Python language syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. because keywords have special meanings and are reserved by the language, using them as variable names will result in a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Mutability in Python refers to whether an object’s value can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Mutable objects can be modified after creation. You can change their content without creating a new object.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Immutable objects cannot be changed once created. Any modification results in a new object being created.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans. the  lists are mutable to provide flexibility, while tuples are immutable to provide safety, hashability, and performance benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans. \"==\" (Equality Operator)\n",
        "        *  Checks if the values of two objects are equal.\n",
        "           Compares the contents or data of the objects.\n",
        "            It calls the __eq__() method internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "           * is (Identity Operator)\n",
        "            Checks if two references point to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "             Compares the identity of the objects, not their contents.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans. Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and return a Boolean result (True or False). They help in building complex logical expressions.  \n",
        "\n",
        " * three main logic operators in python\n",
        " 1 and logical operator.\n",
        " 2 or logical operator.\n",
        " 3 not logical operator.\n",
        "\n",
        " 9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans. Type casting in Python is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. This is useful when you need to perform operations that require specific data types or when you want to ensure data is in the correct format.\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans. 1. Implicit Type Casting (Type Coercion)\n",
        " * Performed automatically by Python without programmer intervention.\n",
        " * Happens when Python automatically converts one data type to another to avoid data loss or errors during operations.\n",
        " * Usually occurs in expressions involving mixed data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2.  Explicit Type Casting (Type Conversion)\n",
        "      * Performed manually by the programmer using built-in functions.\n",
        "      * Requires the programmer to explicitly specify the target data type.\n",
        "      * Used when you want to convert data types intentionally.  \n",
        "\n",
        " 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans. In Python, conditional statements are used to make decisions in  program by executing certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are true.\n",
        "\n",
        " 12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans. the elif statement is short for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions sequentially after an initial if statement. It allows you to test several expressions and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to True.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans.  'for 'loop\n",
        "   * Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
        "   * The number of iterations is usually known or finite.\n",
        "   * It automatically moves through each item in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "   'while' loop\n",
        "   * Repeats as long as a condition is True.\n",
        "   * The number of iterations is not necessarily known beforehand.\n",
        "   * You control the loop continuation explicitly with a condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "  14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ans. A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in scenarios where the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition that changes dynamically during execution.\n",
